# Employees management app 
- In order to develop this project effectively, we decided to utilize Angular as our framework for the frontend interface, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience. On the backend side, we implemented Node.js alongside the Express framework, which allows for streamlined server-side operations and routing. For our data storage needs, we opted for MySQL as the database solution, providing us with a robust and reliable environment to manage our data efficiently.
- For this project, we developed a total of five distinct pages. These include the Login page, where users can authenticate their access, the Dashboard page that serves as an overview of key information, the Employees page which focuses on personnel data, the Projects page detailing various initiatives, and finally, the Employees-Projects page that combines information on both employees and projects. You can view a visual representation of all these pages in the attached screenshot for your reference.
